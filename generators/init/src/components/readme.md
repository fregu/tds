# Components

Components are reusable UI elements defined by their properties. They can be small as a single element or combined of multiple other components.

Your element should be component if

- It can be used several times in the application
- It is independent of where in the application it is placed
- It can be defined by its properties
- It is dumb with no overall apllication logic.
- It can be described and listed in a style guide.

If your element does not fit in the descriptions above, maybe consider adding it as a Container instead.
